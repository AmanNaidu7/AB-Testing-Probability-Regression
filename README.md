# AB-Testing-Probability-Regression
This project uses python to answer questions concerning probability, AB - Testing & Regression.  It is setup as a quiz where minimal lines of python code are used to answer each question. I used Jupyter Notebooks to complete this project but I have downloaded it as a html file. You can view this file directly using the following link:

Alternatively you may download the html file directly and view it in a browser of your choosing.
